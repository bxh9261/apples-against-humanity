# apples-against-humanity

My final project for AP Comp Sci, in which I made a game with the style of Cards Against Humanity and the cleanliness of Apples to Apples. It was created in Java using the GUI builder Jigloo and run on Eclipse.

The game opens with a Settings Window, in which you can choose the card packs you want (one full of code related-humor, one full of real Apples-To-Apples cards, and one full of cards with my friends' names on them and some inside jokes). You can also set the number of players (must be a number 4-10 or the game will yell at you), and give a name to yourself and the AI players. When youâ€™re ready, you hit play.

On the main screen, the game presents you with a green card, and much like Apples-To-Apples you pick a red card that fits best. All the AIs get a card assigned to them as well. The computer then picks the winning card based on its computery sense of humor (or as some would call it, a random number generator), and the winner is awarded one point on the scoreboard. You can start a new game by clicking the settings button and changing the game parameters.
